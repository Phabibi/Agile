# Agile: Run For Your Kingdom
## Requirements and Specification Document (02/01/2018)

#### Meetings and Project Abstract

This web application, called Agile: Run for your Kingdom, is developed using Agile methodologies by the Tommy Bahamas, an agile team. A breif group meeting, like a scrum, was done after each class. An agreement was made in the first meeting between members to come up with proposals to be reviewed in the second meeting. At initial meeting, four ideas were discussed including a time tracker for tourists, a post-requisite courses finder for SFU students, an interactive gift card center and an employer reference site. Each idea was evalualted for API applicability as well as usefulness, creativity and ease of use and development.

The team decided to take another week for choosing the idea of the project which left a week to prepare the project proposal for the customer. The documentation work was divided among the team members. A project was chosen in the project selection meeting after building on the previous ideas. The selection was done using in-person and online communication due to absence of a team member.

Collaboration tools such as Slack and Google Drive were used to share information and communicate effectively during the selection process. Ideas such as a Rally Racer application that included posting photos at checkpoints and competing with friends and the public were shared. We considered how a post-requisite finder could be implemented, if it was feasible to implement with the time given, and if it solved the problem better than anything currently on the market. Ultimately, the selected application creates virtual tracks of actual outdoor running circuits and turns them into real graphical territories based on geolocation positioning. It was spun from different online .io games such as slither.io or paper.io, and focuses on using the Google Maps API.

Specifically, the application is based on capturing territories represented as squares by running or jogging around in a circuit. To make the game competitive, the user will be ranked according to how frequently the territory was captured as well as how much total territory they have accumulated. A leaderboard will show all the rankings visible to all users. Additionally, users will be able to invade captured territories by running around a larger circuit that includes the captured area, or capture parts of territories by enclosing a part of someone else’s territory in their own new area.

Some features to be implemented in future iterations include: making popular areas difficult to capture or invade, teaming up with other users to capture a territory will make it harder for other users to invade, and viewing fitness stats based on all the exercise the user has done. Other “epics” come from the use of other APIs (in addition to Google Maps) that is being considered to incorporate in Agile such as Google Fit REST API.

#### The Problem and the Solution

The problem is similar to what is solved by few apps where the runner is provided motivation to run, for example, the sound of chasing zombies or dogs. The application follows a similar ideology to the PokémonGo game that gained lot of popularity among people of all ages by encouraging them to go outside in hopes of catching Pokémon. Agile: Run for your Kingdom is focused on getting people outside to run or walk to capture territories contrast to the pokemon game which involved standing at a Pokéstop in order to catch valuable pokémon. Although PokémonGo inspired people to go outside, the main purpose of our game is to make people do physical activity while having fun.  Whether on a morning jog, or trying to get motivated to go for a run, our game provides a goal for users to work toward. In addition, since ranked games and competing against other people on a live platform are popular these days, Agile will follow a similar pattern by having a live leaderboard and displaying peoples' territories near you.

This application makes it easy to live a healthier life  by encouraging users to go outside with incentive to compete against other users and become “king of the world” by capturing the most territories. It provides the thrill of an online multiplayer game, but through real-life adventures. Hence, maintaining an active and healthy lifestyle for the users. This contributes towards the fitness of our society as well as nurturing a healthy community environment and thus is an investment that benefits every user.

**Audience**

The target audience is people who do not currently run, a portion of whom could enjoy playing web games already. The goal is to provide people with motivation who are hoping to start exercising but need a push to get going. In addition, people who already run or walk regularly will enjoy the extra motivation and challenges the app can provide them during their daily exercise.

**Scope**

There is one main feature which involves capturing territories on a map while running or walking. However, the team plans on adding sub features as mentioned in the abstract such as a territorial ranking system, group/team territories, and being able to eliminate other players while they are in the process of capturing a territory. The difficulty of using the app We also  crowded or popular area was considered; The solution involves repeating the circuit around the desired area multiple times to capture it to make it more difficult and time consuming. We believe that because the main feature implementation will be demanding, only adding smaller features to accentuate it will make this project feasible for five team members to complete in the time we are given.

**Sample Stories and Scenarios**

I want to be the king of my local territory, so I run around the same area frequently with the web app open on my mobile device that tracks my geographical path. Then I go home and check on the web page (on a phone or computer) to see how I ranked and see who else is competing with me in the same area.
I have been using the web app for awhile now and I log into my account to check my local ranking. I see that I have dropped significantly and feel motivated to go for a run this evening to try and work my way back up the leaderboard.
Members may move to a new neighborhood and want to make new friends or find a new running partner. They could look in the app and see where other members regularly run to get an idea of popular running routes.
Other things I can do are:

Customize a territory if I own it with images or icons.
Take over somebody else’s territory, fully or partially.
Join forces with other people to make a team territory which is harder for others to capture from us.
